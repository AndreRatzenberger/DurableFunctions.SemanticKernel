# .NET 8 Isolated - Durable Functions + Semantic Kernel Integration Project

This repository hosts multiple tutorial projects demonstrating the integration of Azure Durable Functions as .NET 8 isolated implementation and using Semantic Kernel powered Agents to orchestrate complex task with the ability of self-improvement of Agents and how to orchestrate them

It focuses on constructing Language Learning Model (LLM)-based agents, specifically showcasing the tools Semantic Kernel does offer and how to realize seamless integration with the Durable Functions framework. 

The goal is to familiarize developers with the core concepts of Semantic Kernel and the orchestration capabilities of Durable Functions, allowing for sophisticated management of LLM interactions.

## Quick overview of all examples

#### Example 01 - DurableFunctions.SemanticKernel-01

Simple Durable Functions Project implementing the basics of Durable Functions and building a SemanticKernel Kernel to act as a small agent that can answer simple questions.


## More Info

For information about the examples take a look at the README.md in the example folder.

## Future Directions

I don't know yet where the journey leads us to but potential for expanding this project is vast, including:

- **Advanced Agent Capabilities**: Explore adding agents with specialized skills or knowledge areas, such as language translation, code generation, or data analysis.
- **Enhanced Orchestration Logic**: Implement more complex orchestration logic that allows agents to collaborate on tasks, pass messages, and make decisions based on previous interactions.
- **Semantic Kernel Extensions**: Delve into developing custom plugins for Semantic Kernel, potentially opening new avenues for task management, scheduling, or integrating with third-party services.
