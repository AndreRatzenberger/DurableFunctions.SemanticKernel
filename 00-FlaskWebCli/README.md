# Flask CLI for Durable Functions and Semantic Kernel Tutorial Series

This Flask application provides a Command Line Interface (CLI)-like frontend for interacting with the Durable Functions and Semantic Kernel tutorial series. It allows users to send commands to the Durable Functions and displays logs generated by the function app in real-time within a web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

## Installation

Thanks to the preconfigured `tasks.json` file in each tutorial project, setting up and running the Flask CLI app is straightforward.

1. **Open the Tutorial Project**: Open any of the tutorial projects from this series in Visual Studio Code.

2. **No Manual Installation Required**: Installation of all necessary Python packages and configurations are automatically handled by the `tasks.json` file included in each tutorial project.

## Usage

To use the Flask CLI app, simply execute the provided VS Code task:

1. **Open the Command Palette** in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

2. **Run the Task**: Type `Tasks: Run Task` and select it. Then, choose the `### Run (FlaskApp + Function)` task from the list.

This task will:

- Install all required Python packages.
- Start the Flask app.
- Launch the Durable Function app.

After executing the task, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/` in your web browser to access the CLI interface. This interface allows you to send commands to the Durable Functions, with logs and responses displayed directly within the web page.

### Sending Commands

Simply enter your command in the input field provided on the web page and click "Send". The command will be processed by the Durable Function, and any resulting logs will be displayed in the CLI interface.

### Viewing and Clearing Logs

Logs generated by the function app will appear in real-time within the CLI interface on the webpage. To clear the displayed logs, use the command `cli.clear`.
